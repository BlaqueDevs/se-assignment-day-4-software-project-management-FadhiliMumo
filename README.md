# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Market competitiveness - ensuring a software is available when neede and delayed timing will lead to is decline in demnd
Helps identify early risk of yhe project and gives an ample time to find a solution to these projects


They ensure deadlines are met by defineing clear objectives and goals that will be broken down and formed to workplan
Monitoring and tracking clear expecttions and their relation to the worklan
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
facilitates risk managemnt
ensures budget adhererance

Startegies include Accurate and realistic budget Estimation,
    Iterative approach forcasting frquent milestone reviews.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall mothodology has a sequential or linear incremental approach while the agile has an iterative inremental approach
Waterfall is defined in distinctive project phases as for agile project phases aredefined by iterative sprint reviews
Advantage waterfall;
Has aclear structure and flow of developemnt phases.
it is predictable.
Disadvantage of waterfall;
It is inflexible- it does not fit in evolving changes in the system.
Testing is done at the the developement making debugging even more difficult at that stage.
Advantage of Agile;
Flexibility since it offers responsive feedback of the ssytems functionlity at an early stage
debugging id more easier and it can accomadate evolving changes within the system.
Disdavantage of the Agile;
it is less predictable of the final product
It is hard to scale.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile methodology is for dynamic projects that require flexibility and frequent feedback such as software development.
waterfall methodology is for clearly defined project that are unlikely to chane during development.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Define clear requirements
Manual testing testing to see if the code best suites the defined requirments
Importance;
Customer satisfaction when the system best fits the customers expectations.
Sustainability high sustained software is easy to maintain and troubleshoot


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Establishes  clear defined goals
defines what the software will deliver and the requirements

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
This will help the developer to keep track of time during the milestones to avoid unnecessary deadlines.
a gantt chart will give a clear reresentaion of the time, activities to do and progress made during the development
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Will lead to clear undrestanding of the issue and help focus on the root cause of the problem
Provides a road map for action

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
priotizing the most impactfull issues and the and the measure of successs offered by the solution
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
UI-how the users will find it easy to learn and use a system
Security features- Having strong security measures to protect the privacy of the users.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Gives better of knowledge of the markets arising technologies
Gives ideas on what the customers expect
